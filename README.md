As an honors project, I dove into big-O notation, and how this concept is used to compare the time efficiency of  2 or more programs.
I implemented 2 different data structures and compared these programs using empirical and analytical performance analysis.
This process used multiple programs such as Callgrind on a Debian virtual machine, and the data structures were implemented in C++. 
The project was wrapped into a report, which can be found with the programs I created and used in this Github repository.
